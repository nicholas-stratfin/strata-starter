### Layer 1: What do they even do?
Uber is a global technology platform that connects people who need rides, food delivery, or freight services with people who can provide these services. Think of it as three massive digital marketplaces rolled into one:

1. **Mobility (Rides)**: Connects riders with drivers
2. **Delivery**: Connects hungry people with restaurants and stores
3. **Freight**: Connects shipping companies with trucking carriers

Key metrics that show the scale of their business:
- 150 million monthly active users (up 15% from 2022)
- 9.4 billion trips completed in 2023
- Operating in 70+ countries and 10,000+ cities
- $137.9 billion in total gross bookings (the total value of transactions)

The business model is straightforward: Uber takes a cut of each transaction that happens on their platform. They've also added new revenue streams like advertising and membership programs (Uber One).

### Layer 2: Are they winning?
Uber is currently dominating the ride-hailing space in most markets, but faces different competitors in each segment:

**Mobility Competition**:
- Lyft (US)
- Didi (China)
- Ola (India)
- Bolt (Europe)
- Traditional taxis and public transit

**Delivery Competition**:
- DoorDash
- Deliveroo
- Instacart
- Local delivery services

**Key Competitive Metrics (2023)**:
- Revenue growth: 17% YoY
- Trip growth: 24% YoY
- Adjusted EBITDA: $4.1B (137% increase)

These numbers suggest Uber is winning in most markets, particularly in achieving profitability while maintaining growth.

### Layer 3: Who buys their stuff?
Revenue breakdown by segment (2023):
- Mobility: $19.8B (53% of revenue)
- Delivery: $12.2B (33% of revenue)
- Freight: $5.2B (14% of revenue)

Customer base:
- Core consumers: Urban dwellers, professionals
- Business customers: Corporate accounts
- Merchants: Restaurants, retailers
- Freight clients: Shipping companies
- Advertisers: 550,000+ active advertising merchants

### Layer 4: How do they spend their money?
2023 Cost Structure:
- Cost of Revenue: $22.5B (60% of revenue)
- Operating & Support: $2.7B (7.2%)
- R&D: $3.2B (8.5%)
- Sales & Marketing: $4.4B (11.7%)

Margin Trends:
- Gross margin improved from 38.3% (2022) to 39.8% (2023)
- Achieved operating profit of $1.1B in 2023 vs. -$1.8B loss in 2022
- Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded significantly

### Layer 5: Can they pay everyone?
Uber has shown strong financial improvement:
- Generated positive operating income ($1.1B) for the first time in 2023
- Net income of $1.9B in 2023 (vs. -$9.1B loss in 2022)
- Adjusted EBITDA of $4.1B shows strong cash generation
- Multiple revenue streams provide financial stability

### Layer 6: Do they have Seven Powers?
1. **Network Effects**: Strong two-sided marketplace in all segments
2. **Scale Economies**: Spreading tech infrastructure costs across massive transaction volume
3. **Counter Positioning**: Traditional taxi and delivery services struggle to match their digital efficiency
4. **Switching Costs**: Medium (through Uber One membership program)
5. **Brand**: Very strong, "Uber" has become a verb
6. **Cornered Resource**: Vast data on transportation patterns and user behavior
7. **Process Power**: Advanced routing and pricing algorithms

### Layer 7: What do we have to believe?
To believe in Uber's long-term success, you need to believe:

1. **Platform Integration**: The "Super App" strategy will continue driving cross-platform usage and efficiency

2. **Regulatory Environment**: Uber can maintain contractor status for drivers or adapt profitably to employee classification

3. **Margin Expansion**: Recent profitability improvements are sustainable and can continue

4. **New Revenue Streams**: Advertising and membership programs will grow significantly

5. **Technology Leadership**: Uber can maintain its tech advantage as autonomous vehicles and other innovations emerge

The bull case rests on Uber's ability to leverage its massive scale and data advantages while expanding margins and defending against regulatory challenges. The bear case focuses on potential driver reclassification risks and intense competition in key markets.
